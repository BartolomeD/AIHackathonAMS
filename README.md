## 1. Ideas

### Challenge 1 (Microsoft NWOW)

**Issue**: During the daily conversations slack feeds or mailchains sometimes are full unnecessary comments, GIFs, jokes or cat videos which destracts from work

**Idea**: Create a smart filter using MS graph API and Cognitive services for office emailing / instant messaging (Skype / Skype for business), which reduces automatically the "noise" from the conversations, filtering out the walkie-talkie parts focusing only the action points making work effective again! ðŸ¤“

**Issue**: Phishing is a number 1 threat for companies in terms of data security because of their unskilled employess or advanced phishing methodologies.

**Idea**: Create a smart blocking system which can analyze the incoming mails / messages, and separate malicious ones saving millions of unintentional data leak (and $).
