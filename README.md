## 1. Ideas

### Challenge 1 (Microsoft NWOW)

**Issue**: During the daily conversations slack feeds or mailchains sometimes are full unnecessary comments, GIFs, jokes or cat videos which destracts from work

**Idea**: Create a smart filter using MS graph API and Cognitive services for office emailing / instant messaging (Skype / Skype for business), which reduces automatically the "noise" from the conversations, filtering out the walkie-talkie parts focusing only the action points making work effective again! ðŸ¤“

**Issue**: Phishing is a number 1 threat for companies in terms of data security because of their unskilled employess or advanced phishing methodologies.

**Idea**: Create a smart blocking system which can analyze the incoming mails / messages, and separate malicious ones saving millions of unintentional data leak (and $).

### Challenge 3 (Emotional AI)

**Issue**: Autists are generally struggling to realize and express human emotions

**Idea**: What if we create an emotional dictionary for autists and their parents to help the communication between them and ease their everyday life with a little online webapp with facial recognition

**Issue**: Learning a foreign language is hard and the learning can be daunting sometimes, but if we find the enjoyment part all the effort we put in it just becomes fun. 

**Idea**: Let's create a platform where people can learn useful phrases and the basics of the language based on their favorite songs / TV series simply by matching the url and a situation of the song on Youtube / Netflix. (Think about Italian or Latin soap operas, where you really don't know if they just talk or heavily arguing about something!)

Extra: Spotify songs can be integrated too, where basically you don't even see the face of the singer and not every song has a music video by default

**Issue**: One of the main reasons people are living their company (besid money) is that they feel burnout, or stucked at the position they currently have, which is especially true for the millenials.

**Idea**: What if we create an emotional blog for employees where they can record their daily good & bad happenings by voice recording and the platform would automatically do a sentiment analysis detecting the tone and the mood during the day. In case of longer term thinking this might be a tool for the employer also to monitor anonimously the situation of the company, which area they should change or motivate people more with something else.

**Issue**: The YouTube is full of best of moments of movies and TV shows in different languages to show the best parts for the wider audience without watching the full movie

**Idea**: Let's create a searchable video library which can scan YouTube and Netflix videos by a simple search term, so it's easy to get to the "best part" anytime without clicking around the whole timeline
